# Time-Series-Forecasting
Overview:
The goal of this project is to leverage historical sales data to forecast future sales trends. Accurate sales forecasting is critical for businesses to optimize inventory management, plan marketing strategies, and improve overall financial performance. This project utilizes various machine learning and statistical techniques to achieve reliable and accurate forecasts.

Features
Data Preprocessing
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the sales data.

Data Transformation: Converting raw sales data into a format suitable for analysis, including time series indexing and aggregation.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Trend Analysis: Identifying long-term trends in sales data.

Seasonality Detection: Analyzing seasonal patterns and recurring fluctuations in sales.

Anomaly Detection: Detecting and visualizing anomalies and outliers in the sales data.

Modeling
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): Traditional time series model that captures trend and seasonality.

Prophet: A robust forecasting tool developed by Facebook, suitable for handling missing data and outliers.

Machine Learning Algorithms: Implementing models like XGBoost and Random Forest to capture complex patterns and interactions in the data.

Model Evaluation
Metrics: Using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to evaluate model performance.

Cross-Validation: Employing cross-validation techniques to ensure model robustness and prevent overfitting.

Forecasting
Forecast Generation: Producing sales forecasts for future periods.

Visualization: Creating plots and charts to visualize forecasted sales against actual sales data.

Usage
Install Dependencies: Use the command pip install -r requirements.txt to install necessary libraries.

Run Exploratory Data Analysis: Execute python eda.py to perform EDA and visualize data insights.

Train Models: Use python train.py to train the models on the historical sales data.

Generate Forecasts: Run python forecast.py to generate and visualize sales forecasts.
